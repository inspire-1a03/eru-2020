# ERU - Day 3 & 4 Worksheet

## The great Arduino Build-off
During days 3 and 4 of the module, students will put their newly-developed skills to the test to build a prototype device that incorporates most of the components in their kit, and performs a number of interesting, useful, or entertaining functions. You will have some time at the end of day 2 to brainstorm device ideas with your peers. 

You have a great deal of freedom in creating your device, though it must use sensors to collect information from the environment, and subsequently use that information to provide feedback--whether using LEDs, the buzzer, the serial monitor, etc. Specifically, your device must meet a few criteria: 
1. Your device must incorporate at least three of the four input devices provided (photoresistor, potentiometer, thermistor, button)
2. Your device must use the RGB LED, and the buzzer. You can use as many or as few of the other LEDs as you'd like. 
3. Your device should be built on the principle that it provides some sort of value to a human (or other sentient beings). The purpose may for information, utility, entertainment, education, novelty, etc. You should be sure to articulate the purpose(s) in your final summary and sales pitch video. 

This portion of your module has three deliverables, which will all be added to your module GitHub repository and/or your project webpage (via the index.md file):
1. The fully-commented Arduino sketch from your final product, uploaded to the top-level of your module GitHub repository.
2. A ~300 word description of your device that explains:
- What the device does. Use a table (created in markdown) to list and describe the features. You can use the template provided in the comments of your index.md file. 
- How your device works (briefly).
- How it could be used in everyday life (or maybe just in rare cases)? 
- Be sure to link to your code (in your GitHub repository) in the text of your response.
- Include a small snippet of code into the webpage using the \``` characters to display the code properly. 

Refer to the [course outline page](eru-outline.md) for more information on evaluation.

## Final reflection and summary 
In the appropriate section of your index.md file, use ~300 words to reflect on your experience in this module:
- Summarize your experience in this module. What you learned, what you liked, what you found challenging.
- Reflect upon your learning and its relevance in your life.
